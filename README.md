  This is my project for FreeCodeCamp.org about an <b>Image Classifier of Cats and Dogs for the Machine Learning with Python</b> course.
</h3>
<h6>
This is a classification task in the domain of computer vision using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. The goal is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either a "dog" or "cat", with a minimum accuracy of 63%. The project requires the use of TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model, with the aim of correctly classifying images of cats and dogs. Higher accuracy of 70% or above is considered as extra credit. My accuracy was of 76%.
